<h1>The Cruel Prince</h1>
<h2>By:Holly Black</h2>
<p>I personally like the book The Cruel Prince because it doesn't romanticize Faerie, it's depicted as beautiful but deadly. That Jude refuses to back down in a world designed to kill her is the thing that makes the book inspiring, and how ambitious and flawed she is, I love. The push-and-pull between her and Cardan generates so much tension that the book becomes both merciless and irresistible. Holly Black's work makes the world come alive, with politics, betrayal, and magic all mixed together in a way that makes me hooked from start to finish.</p>
