<h1>The Cruel Prince</h1>
<h2>By:Holly Black</h2>


<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>Jude Duarte (the narrator) recalls the night her world shattered. A stranger—Madoc, a faerie general—arrives at her family’s home, murders her mortal parents, and takes her and her sisters, Vivienne (Vivi) and Taryn, to live in Faerie. Vivi is Madoc’s biological daughter, but Jude and Taryn are mortals. From this moment, Jude is thrust into a land where mortals are vulnerable and despised.</p>


<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>Growing up in Elfhame, Jude struggles with being mortal among powerful, magical faeries. She feels out of place but also begins to crave belonging and respect. She learns that faeries view mortals as weak and often toy with them cruelly. Jude is already forming the steel inside her—she won’t accept being powerless.</p>


<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
<p>We see Jude and Taryn as teenagers attending lessons with faeries. Cardan, the youngest prince, and his group of friends—including Nicasia, Valerian, and Locke—taunt and torment Jude. Despite the danger, Jude refuses to bow to them, showing her stubbornness and pride.</p>
