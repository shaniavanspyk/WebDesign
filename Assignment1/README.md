#The Gorg

##Directed By:Scott Derrickson


I love The Gorge most of all for its genre blend. Instead of playing it straight down the center, it combines sci-fi, romance, horror, and action into a story that is as fresh as it is unpredictable. The romance gives the film its heart, the horror its tension, and the action its breakneck speed. That combination makes the movie feel alive and constantly surprising, but the shifts always worked together. For me, the genre mix is what makes The Gorge stand out.
