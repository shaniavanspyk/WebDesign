How are you doing?
I'm feeling pretty good and this class has pushed me to challeng myself and have lots of patience

Can I do anything specifically to help you inside and/or outside of class?
You have been really good with all the support and feedback you have given and something that would help is any visuals to help with any assignments are appriciated as I'm a visual learner

How did this module go for you?
It went really well for me as this is where I started to push the limits and explore new things.
