While building my website, I learned how to add animations using JavaScript and insert them into my HTML. This made my site feel much more interactive and visually engaging, and it’s a skill I know will be helpful for future website projects.
I balanced creativity with usability by adding buttons and using photos in a way that supported my layout instead of distracting from it. These choices helped keep the site visually interesting while still being easy for visitors to navigate.
There are many things I’m proud of in my final project because it really shows how much I’ve learned. The JavaScript animation, the portfolio section, and the parallax scrolling on my homepage all reflect the effort I put in. I’m especially proud of the portfolio, since organizing everything took a lot of time and taught me how to structure information effectively.
In the future, I would like to add more to the homepage, such as contact information, links to my social media, and more to the “about me” section—to make the site feel more complete and personal, maybe like a timeline of me creating art.
I can see myself using these skills in future school assignments and personal projects. Building the websites in this class has opened up more opportunities for me to showcase my creativity in new ways.
